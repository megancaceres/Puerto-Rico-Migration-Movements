  <p>
    Out of all the islands in the Caribbean, Puerto Rico experienced the most wrath and devastation from the overwhelming brunt of two major hurricanes, who came months apart and within the same year. </p>
  <p> The impact of hurricane Maria and Irma was not only felt on the island, but was also felt on the United States Mainland, where thousands of Puerto Ricans relocated and settled post hurricanes.
  </p>

  <p> Using data collected by the United States Census Bureau, with data stemming from the American Community Survey, we concluded that this massive and continuing post-Maria and Irma exodus of Puerto Ricans, has led to an overall increase in the
    number of Puerto Ricans living on the mainland overall. </p>
  <p> Based on the data from the United States Census Bureau, you will notice that in the last few years and after both hurricanes, Florida has been a magnet for relocating Puerto Ricans.</p>
  <p> Hurricane Maria and Irma were in 2017, and the data demonstrates that since 2017, Florida has become the chosen place of settlement for Puerto Ricans. </p>
  <p>Given the importance that population size and growth have in the social and political discourse in the United States, this increase will contribute in making Puerto Ricans more visible
    politically, socially, culturally and economically.

  <p> The primary relocation destination and magnet for most Puerto Ricans has been Florida, but we also saw relocation patterns in Pennsylvania, New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Illinois and New Jersey. </p>
  <p> Some of the reasons for this gravitation towards Florida, is the proximity, which is only a two-and-a-half hour flight away from their Island. Another reason is the weather, which is identical to their tropical environment. Finally, the
    cost of living.</p>
  <p> Based on the data from the maps above, since 2017, about 18,000 Puerto Ricans have moved to Florida, and there could be more that were not counted.</p>

  <p> The cost of living in Florida is cheaper compared to other states, which is comforting for most Puerto Ricans who are coming from a tarnished economy, and very humble and minimalistic beginnings.</p>
  <p> One thing to also note is that prior to all these hurricanes and the downfall of Puerto Rico, several Puerto Rican families had already relocated and established themselves in Florida for various personal reasons, therefore, there was
    an incentive for Puerto Ricans relocating after the hurricanes, as it made the relocation process smoother. </p>

  <p>With increased mobility of people across the United States Mainland, however, a weather event that takes place in the Caribbean affects communities not just there, but also far and away.</p>
  <p> Florida was a primary hub for relocation, and there were specific communities in Florida that experienced such a great an influx of relocators, that they were not physically or economically capable to receive them. </p>
  <p> Florida’s school districts were the most impacted of incoming school age children from Puerto Rico as a result of the exodus after Hurricane Maria. </p>
  <p> According to Jennifer Hinojosa, a Research Associate and Data Center Coordinator at the <a href="https://centropr.hunter.cuny.edu/" text="align">Center for Puerto Rican Studies at CUNY Hunter College</a>, Puerto Ricans relocating to Florida is
    not shocking or anything new. </p>
  <p> "Florida was always a traditional state of settlement, there is a long history of Puerto Ricans settling in Florida. The 2018 Census data tells us that Florida is the state with the largest population of Puerto Rican, but for many
    decades, New York had the largest population of Puerto Ricans. This tells us that Puerto Ricans are choosing to relocate to Florida over places like New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. New York, and most of the Northeast, has a
    higher cost of living when comparing it to Florida, and Florida is much closer to Puerto Rico. But although New York has been losing the Puerto Rican population overtime, what shocked us was that within New York state, after Hurricane
    Maria and Irma, Puerto Ricans were going to upstate New York and settling there. Although Puerto Rican populations have settled predominantly in New York City for years, the drive for Puerto Ricans to relocate this time around was cost
    of living, and upstate New York is by far cheaper than New York City, she says".</p>

  <p> The center for Puerto Rican Studies at CUNY Hunter College, worked in collaboration with the Florida Department of Education to create some visuals which would show just how many Puerto Ricans stormed into Florida after the
    Hurricanes.</p>
  <p> At the time, a report they published in March, 2018, stated that counties such as Miami Dade, Osceola, and Orange county, were getting the largest incoming flow of Puerto Ricans. The methdology for this report consisted of
    using
    school enrollment and FEMA changeof-addresses data as indicators of the relocation of Puerto Rican migrants to the U.S. mainland.</p>
  <p> The assumption was that families that enrolled their children in a state’s school system would be more likely to stay over a longer period of time or to relocate permanently than families that had a shorter window of time in
    mind and that chose not to enroll their children in schools. </p>

  <p> Since before the hurricanes in 2017, Puerto Ricans have been relocating and moving around within their own island. The map below shows the residnetial population by municipality from 2017 to 2019. Based on the data I composited from
    the U.S. Census Bureau, you can see that within this two-year-time frame, Puerto Ricans have really been moving around, and every municipality with the exception of one, has decreased in population.
  <p> The decrease in population for almost every
    municipality can be attrbitued to either Puerto Ricans moving to a different municipality within the island, or Puerto Ricans moving completely away from the island and leaving for the mainland.</p>
  <p> The point of this data is to show that Puerto
    Ricans move a lot, and it is hard to keep track in part because they are American citizens moving casually within the United States. Not only this, but this data shows the time period between 2017 and 2019, with both hurricane Maria and Irma
    taking place in 2017, therefore, it can be assumed that the decrease in population for every municipality in Puerto Rico, minus the exception of one municipality, is due to the hurricane, and those part of the decreasing population have left to
    either the United States or another coountry. </p>

  <p> Puerto Ricans will continue to move around and relocate to the United States mainland in search of political, social, cultural, and economical stability, something they lack at home, but seem to find on the United states
    mainland year after
    year. </p>
