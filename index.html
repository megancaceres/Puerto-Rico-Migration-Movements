  <p>
    Out of all the islands in the Caribbean, Puerto Rico endured the overwhelming brunt of two major hurricanes within the same year, months apart.
  </p>
  <p> The impact of the storms was not only felt on the island, but was also felt on the United States Mainland, where thousands of Puerto Ricans relocated and settled post hurricane Maria and Irma.
  </p>

  <p>With increased mobility of people across the United States Mainland, however, a weather event that takes place in the Caribbean affects communities not just there, but also far and away.</p>

  <p> Using data collected by the United States Census Bureau, with data stemming from the American Community Survey, we concluded that this massive and continuing post-Maria and Irma exodus of Puerto Ricans, has led to an overall increase in the
    number of Puerto Ricans living stateside overall. Given the importance that population size and growth have in the social and political discourse in the United States, this increase will contribute in making Puerto Ricans more visible
    politically, socially, culturally and economically.
  </p>

  <p> The primary relocation destination for most Puerto Ricans has been Florida, but we also saw relocation patterns in Pennsylvania, New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Illinois and New Jersey. </p>
  <p> Some of the reasons for this gravitation towards Florida, is the proximity, only a two and a half hour flight away from their Island. The weather, basically identical to their tropical environment, and finally, the cost of living. The cost of
    living in Florida is cheaper compared to other states, which is comforting for most Puerto Ricans who are coming from a tarnished economy, and very humble and minimalistic beginnings. One thing to also note is that prior to all these hurricanes
    and the downfall of Puerto Rico, several Puerto Rican families had already relocated and established themselves in Florida for various personal reasons, therefore, there was an incentive for Puerto Ricans relocating after the hurricanes, as it
    made the relocation process smoother. </p>
